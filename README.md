# enbasic-js
Validates text input against Ogden's basic english.
Ogden's basic english is a list of words that can be combined together to create almost any concept in the English language.
Validating your text against this word list can be very useful for foreign language speakers and people with below average reading skill,
making your text more accessible and easier to comprehend

As a developer, when I write it is usually my job to inform users as clearly and plainly as possible.  
I will often find myself writing long words or overly-complicated phrases to make my text seem more interesting, when I should be trying to
write in a way that is simple and accessible. 
Schools train us to write novels not documentation and learning to write in this new way has been rewarding.
Checking my text against the basic english word list helps me to find places where I can simplify my writing and hopefully increase understanding.
